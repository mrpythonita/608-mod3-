# Project: 608-mod3
-------------------------
## Introduction 
The scope of this project is to use both Python native programming functionalities, and the statistics and random module to calculate measure of dispersion such as population variance and population standard deviation. Furthermore the document creates ad hoc functions and  classes in python.
## Getting Started

There are two datasets available for this project. One his randomly generated data while the second one comes from Missouri Historical Agricultural Weather Database.

## Prerequisites

Python 3 is the environment utilized with the addition of the following libraries:

* __statistics__ (+ dependencies) 
* __nupmpy__. (+ dependencies) 
* __random__. (+ dependencies) 

## Installing

```
import statistics,random
import numpy as np

```

## Deployment

* **bult-in-min-max.py**: python file for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
* **playing-craps.py**: python for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
* **calculator.py**: python for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
* **custom-object.py**: python for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
* **population-dispersion.py**: python for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
* **bonus.py**: python for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
